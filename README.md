# FixMyCity---Local-Community-Issue-Tracker
FixMyCity is a web application for citizens to report local civic issues (potholes, broken lights, garbage, vandalism), for officers to manage and resolve them, and for admins to analyze performance and transparency.

# 1.Project overview
## Problem: 
Citizens lack a simple, transparent channel to report and track local civic issues. Authorities
need a clear workflow and analytics to prioritize and close issues.

## Solution: 
A full-stack web application where citizens submit geo-tagged reports with photos, officers
triage and resolve reports, and admins monitor KPIs. All actions are logged for transparency.

## Primary users / roles: - 
Citizen: create reports, view status, comment, upvote reports - Officer: view
assigned reports, update status, add notes, upload evidence - Admin: manage users, reassign,
analytics, configure workflows
